Aim: To create a game where the user plays rock, paper, scissors against the computer.

Procedure:

 1. Define possible choices: rock, paper, and scissors.

 2. Get the user's choice and randomly select the computer's choice.

 3. Compare the two choices based on the rules of the game.

 4. Determine and print the winner or declare a tie.

 5. Repeat the process to play the game.

Program:

import random

def play_game():

 choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

 #Get user input for their choice

 user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): ").lower()

 # Validate user input

 if user_choice not in choices: 

 print("Invalid choice. Please choose rock, paper, or scissors.")

 return

 # Computer randomly selects its choice

 computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

 # Display choices

 print(f"\nYou chose: {user_choice}")

 print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}\n")

 #Determine the winner

 if user_choice == computer_choice:

print("It's a tie!")

 elif (

 (user_choice =="rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or

 (user_choice=="paper" and computer_choice =="rock") or

 (user_choice =="scissors" and computer_choice== "paper")

 ):

 print("You win!")

 else:

 print("Computer wins!")
