Exercise 2: Sum of Series Using Recursion

Aim: To calculate the sum of the series 12 + 22 + 32 + ... + N2 using recursion.

Procedure:

 1. Create a recursive function to calculate the sum of the squares up to a given number.

 2. The base case returns 0 if the input number is 0.

 3. For other cases, return the square of the number plus the recursive sum of the remaining 

series.

 4. Input the value of N and call the recursive function.

 5. Print the result.

Program:

def sum_of_square_series(number):

 if(number == 0):

 return 0

 else:

 return (number * number) + sum_of_square_series(number - 1)

num = int(input("Please Enter any Positive Number : "))

total = sum_of_square_series(num)

print("The Sum of Series upto {0} = {1}".format(num, total))
